## Investigation the use of radiomics for analysis of DAT SPECT imaging in Parkinson's Disease

The aim of the homework is to prepare a technical report which should provide a justified opinion on the use of radiomics analysis for DAT SPECT imaging as biomarker of PD
### RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
By using the data collected from a PD study, this report should address the following questions:
1. GROUP DIFFERENCES
- Is there any difference between controls and PD in radiomics features (or combined score)?
- Are the radiomic features or any derived scores associated to PD clinical symptoms severity?
2. INDIVIDUAL PREDICTION
- Are the radiomics features capable to distinguish patients from controls?
